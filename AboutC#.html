            <h2>C#</h2>
            <h3>C# is one of the most used programming in the world and a little more than 20 years old. It is owned by Microsoft and made because they needed a middleground between an easy to use and powerfull programming language. It is very similar to Java but is a bit more modern.</h3>
            <h3> I have written thousands of lines in code in C# but I primarily use C# together with Unity and not on its on. I have made, however, some projects in C# outside a game engine. I made, for example, a virus in C#. This virus was a keylogger and once installed on someones computer could record every key the person pressed. I even made it so that the program sends every 1,000 letters to my email adress. If I would install this to someones computer or would hide it in for example a JrJones download I could steal all that persons passwords because I would see them in all the characters I get emailed. This is obviously highly illegal, so I would never do something like that. But the fact that it is so illegal makes it one of my coolest projects I have ever made.  </h3>
